- create .dat file:
	$ strfile tao-zensho-de

- copy both files "tao-zensho-de" and "tao-zensho-de.dat" to folder /usr/share/fortune (or wherever your fortune installation is looking for fortune database files)

Now you can use tao-zensho-de as fortune mod.

You can "fortune tao-zensho-de" in your shell startup file.
